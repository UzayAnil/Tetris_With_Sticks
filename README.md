Game Play:
In each turn, you are given a block of varying length.
Type in the position to place the block on the board.
The block will be placed in the first available row from the bottom at the given position.
If the placement is outside of the board, you will be given the same block again.
Earning (or losing :)) points:
Successful block placement: +1
Unsuccessful block placement: -1
Clearing a row: +5
Winning and Losing:
If the blocks reach the top, you lose!
There is no Winning, so play until you lose.
